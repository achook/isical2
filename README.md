# isical2

## DEPRECATED

isical2 used to be an app that scrapped timetable data from my university department website and exported it to the ical format.
There are also some files for the server that allowed for easy copying of the links for the respective files.

Then my department changed their timetable system to such that allows exporting timetables.
